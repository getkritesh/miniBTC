Here are the commands necessary to run your c++ code in command prompt.
1. g++ (executes the compiler)
2. -Wall (turns on all warnings)
3. -std=c++14 (uses the 14 c++ standard)
4. main.cpp (the file you want to compile)
5. -o <filename> (creates a custom filename)
custom: (creates a file named: test)
g++ -Wall -std=c++14 main.cpp -o main
compile: (runs file main)
./main
— — — — — — — — — — — — — –
default: (creates default file: a.out)
g++ -Wall -std=c++14 main.cpp 
compile: (runs file a.out)
./a.out

The windows executable is called:
